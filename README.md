 The Number Guessing Game

This game generates a random integer between 1 and 10 and prompts the user to guess what the number is.
The game will keep track of how many tries it takes for the user to guess correctly and will tell the user if their guess is too high or too low.
After guessing correctly, the high score (lowest number of attempts) will be recorded and the game will ask if the user would like to play again.
Choosing to play again will generate a new random number and the game will tell you what the current high score to beat is.
If the player chooses to not play again, the game ends.

Guessing a number outside the range of 1-10 (positive or negative) will throw an error and prompt the user to choose a valid number. Same goes for non-number guesses.
